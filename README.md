# Journal Buddy - Gemini Sample

Developer sample written in Angular, demonstrating how to use the Gemini API to ask questions about a daily journal using natural language prompts.

## Gemini API Key

Running this app requires pasting in a Gemini API key.

Caution: **Using the Google AI SDK for JavaScript directly from a client-side
app is recommended for prototyping only.** For non-prototyping use cases, we
strongly recommend that you call the Google AI Gemini API only server-side to
keep your API key safe. If you embed your API key directly in your JavaScript
app or fetch it remotely at runtime, you risk potentially exposing your API key
to malicious actors.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
